 Paying Bail with Blockchain Challenge
 
**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018) are encouraged to tackle The Paying Bail with Blockchain Challenge.**

 # Overview
 
America's for profit bail system has created an untenable, indeed unjust, social problem wherein bail facilitates mass incarceration and social oppression. Prosecutors and judges, working in concert for the sake of "judicial efficiency", often coerce low-income people to accept plea deals. In New York, 90% of people who canâ€™t pay bail end up pleading guilty. 70% of people in American jails have not yet been convicted of any crime. 

Crowdsourcing bail with blockchain in New York is currently timely and costly. The conversion process is made quite difficult as a result of NY's Bitlicense. New York has only awarded three BitLicenses to date. The process requires approved cryptocurrencies and approved crypto exchanges, and has to jump through convoluted multiple crypto conversions with different traders and trading partners and frictionful conversion fees that undermine what is supposed to be a disintermediated peer-to-peer transaction process. We think there has to be a better way to crowdfund and pay bail for NY detainees without sufficient resources to cover their bail.

 Teams should:
 
* Present a method for utilizing blockchain in the crowdsourcing of bail in the most efficient way possible.

-Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of invited judges. This project can have a major, tangible impact. The team submitting the top-ranked, highest rated corporate structure will be given free subscriptions to The New Inquiry and a 2018 specialty tote. 

More information on challenge criteria and additional prizes and awards will be added to this challenge page as they are finalized.
