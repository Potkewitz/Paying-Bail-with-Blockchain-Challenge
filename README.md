# Paying Bail with Blockchain Challenge Presented by [Bail Bloc](https://bailbloc.thenewinquiry.com) and [BLIP](https://www.brooklaw.edu/academics/clinicalprogram/blip/aboutblip?)

Overview
 
America's for profit bail system has created an untenable, indeed unjust, social problem wherein bail facilitates mass incarceration and social oppression. Prosecutors and judges, working in concert for the sake of "judicial efficiency", often coerce low-income people to accept plea deals. In New York, 90% of people who can’t pay bail end up pleading guilty. 70% of people in American jails have not yet been convicted of any crime. 

Crowdsourcing bail with blockchain in New York is currently timely and costly. The conversion process is made quite difficult as a result of NY's Bitlicense. New York has only awarded three BitLicenses to date. The process requires approved cryptocurrencies and approved crypto exchanges, and has to jump through convoluted multiple crypto conversions with different traders and trading partners and frictionful conversion fees that undermine what is supposed to be a disintermediated peer-to-peer transaction process. We think there has to be a better way to crowdfund and pay bail for NY detainees without sufficient resources to cover their bail.

 Teams should:
 
•	Teams should first consult BailBloc’s open-source code and identify any pitfalls to their current model. The code and project description is available at [Bail Bloc](https://bailbloc.thenewinquiry.com)

•	Present a method for utilizing blockchain in the crowdsourcing of bail for indigent misdemeanor offenders that deals with the complicated New York Bitlicense scheme and the conversion process. Imagine if you could simply pay bail with Monero, BitCoin, or Ether.

-Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of judges with experience in this issue. This project can have a major, tangible impact on the criminal justice system. The team submitting the top-ranked, highest rated corporate structure will be given free subscriptions to The New Inquiry and a 2018 specialty tote.
